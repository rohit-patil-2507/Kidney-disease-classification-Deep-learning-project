## Workflows
## End-to-End Project Workflow

1. Update config.yaml
2. Update secrets.yaml [Optional]
3. Update params.yaml
4. Update the entity
5. Update the configuration manager in src config
6. Update the components
7. Update the pipeline 
8. Update the main.py
9. Update the dvc.yaml
10. app.py
This project follows a structured, modular approach to machine learning pipeline development and deployment. Below is the detailed workflow we followed:

### 1. Environment & Project Setup
- **Template Initialization**: Created the initial directory structure automatically using a custom `template.py` script.
- **Environment**: Set up a Conda virtual environment and installed all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Configuration & Secrets Management
- **Configuration (`config.yaml`)**: Centralized data, model, and tracking paths.
- **Hyperparameters (`params.yaml`)**: Defined model parameters like epochs, batch size, and learning rate.
- **Secrets (`secrets.toml`)**: Handled API keys securely (e.g., Groq API for the chatbot).

### 3. Modular Pipeline Components (`src/cnnClassifier`)
- **Entity Definition**: Created dataclasses (`entity`) to strongly type configuration returns.
- **Configuration Manager**: Built a central manager (`src/config/configuration.py`) to read `config.yaml` and `params.yaml` and provide settings to each component.
- **Stages Implementation**:
  - **Stage 1: Data Ingestion** - Downloading and extracting the dataset.
  - **Stage 2: Prepare Base Model** - Fetching VGG16, freezing base layers, and adding custom dense layers for binary classification (Normal vs. Tumor).
  - **Stage 3: Model Training** - Compiling and training the model using `tf.keras`, utilizing callbacks.
  - **Stage 4: Model Evaluation** - Calculating validation metrics and tracking the experiment via MLflow.

### 4. Orchestration & Experiment Tracking
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: Tied all pipeline stages together via `dvc.yaml`. DVC orchestrates the execution (`dvc repro`) and skips stages that haven't changed.

- **MLflow Integration**: Set up DagsHub as the remote tracking URI to log metrics, parameters, and models securely (with `mlflow_utils.py` handling the experiment lifecycle).

### 5. Application Interfaces
- **Flask API (`app.py`)**: Built a robust backend to handle prediction requests. Added data validation steps (checking image blurriness, valid grayscale scans, and verifying against a secondary CT verification model).

- **Streamlit Explainability App (`streamlit.py`)**: Developed an advanced, medical-themed UI featuring:
  - Single and Batch image prediction capabilities.
  - **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Grad-CAM overlay heatmaps to visualize the model's focus.
  - **Medical Advisory AI**: Integrated LLaMA-3 via Groq API to provide context-aware nephrology advice based on the model's prediction.




# How to run?
### STEPS:

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohit-patil-2507/Kidney-Disease-Classification-Deep-Learning-Project
```
### STEP 01- Create a conda environment after opening the repository

```bash
conda create -n cnncls python=3.12 -y
conda create -n <env>  python==3.10 -y #you can follow this command if you want to use native GPU of ur laptop
```

```bash
conda activate cnncls
```


### STEP 02- install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```bash
# Finally run the following command
python app.py
```

Now,
```bash
open up you local host and port
```

## Streamlit Explainability App

The project also includes a Streamlit front-end for an evaluator-friendly demo.
It supports:

- image upload and sample-image testing
- confidence scores for `Normal` and `Tumor`
- uploaded image plus prediction side by side
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for visual explainability
- preprocessing visualization for resize and normalization
- batch upload predictions
- validation metrics dashboard with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix

Run it locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

For public deployment (Streamlit Community Cloud): keep a deployable model at:

```bash
model/model.h5
```

The app will also use `artifacts/training/model.h5` when it exists locally after training.

### Streamlit Community Cloud deployment
1. Ensure these files exist in your repo:
   - `streamlit_app.py`
   - `requirements-streamlit.txt`
   - `model/model.h5`
2. Push your repo to GitHub.
3. Go to https://share.streamlit.io/ and create a new app.
4. Select your GitHub repository and set:
   - **Main file**: `streamlit_app.py`
   - **Python requirements**: `requirements-streamlit.txt`
5. Run/Save and copy the generated public URL.







## MLflow

- [Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html)

##### cmd
- mlflow ui

### dagshub
[dagshub](https://dagshub.com/)

note:Add your own mlflow tracking uri by creating account and configure settings:

MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://dagshub.com/<username>/<repo-name>.mlflow  /

MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=<username> /
MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=<dagshub-token>  /
python script.py

Run this to export as env variables:

```bash

export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=https://dagshub.com/<username>/<repo-name>.mlflow

export MLFLOW_TRACKING_USERNAME=<username>

export MLFLOW_TRACKING_PASSWORD=<dagshub-token>

```

Remote DagsHub runs log metrics and parameters by default. To upload/register the full Keras model too, enable it explicitly:

```bash
export MLFLOW_LOG_MODEL=true
```


### DVC cmd

1. dvc init
2. dvc repro
3. dvc dag
